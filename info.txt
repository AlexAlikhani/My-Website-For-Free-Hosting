<span id="header">ABOUT ME</span>
<span id="header">========</span>
Hi! I'm <span id="important-info">Ryan Stewart!</span> Welcome to my site. I like <span id="important-info">programming</span>, <span id="important-info">wiring</span>, <span id="important-info">math</span>, and various forms of <span id="important-info">art</span>.

I'm a student trying to graduate early through the <span id="important-info">TAMS</span> program at <span id="important-info">UNT</span>. I'm really interested in the STEM field, and I want to become a software developer when I graduate. I was first introduced to STEM at a very young age, as both my parents were in the field. 

Right now, I'm focusing on <span id="important-info">Arduino</span> and <span id="important-info">Raspberry Pi</span>, as I want to bring my code into the real world. I'm competing to get into the <span id="important-info">Intel Engineering and Science Fair (ISEF)</span> this year, and I'm using my experience with both to create my project.

I also show great interest in language, as I'm learning <span id="important-info">American Sign Language</span> in school and <span id="important-info">Swedish</span> on my own time. I love the idea of communicating in different ways to reach new audiences.


<span id="header">SCHOOLING</span>
<span id="header">=========</span>
I'm currently a sophomore attending <span id="important-info">Jasper High School</span>. My school is very competitive and diverse. At JHS, I'm involved in:

    - <span id="important-info">Student Congress Executive Council</span>
    - <span id="important-info">American Sign Language Honor Society</span>
    - <span id="important-info">LASER Club</span>
    - <span id="important-info">Math Club</span>
    - <span id="important-info">National  Honor Society</span>

I've also attended various CompSci boot-camps at local universities, including a C++ class at <span id="important-info">UTD</span> and a Java class at <span id="important-info">SMU</span>.
